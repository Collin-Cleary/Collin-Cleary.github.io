Hello World
my name is Collin Cleary. I went to Irondequoit High school. I enjoy spending time with friends, cracking jokes,
playing video games, and meeting new people. I tend to procrastinate, and I'm trying to work on that. I need to work out more
I need a healthier diet. I like going on long walks and I've been on a couple since starting at RIT.
If there's anybody looking for a gym buddy, I need to go more anyway. If anybody is trying to make friends, come talk to me.

here is an image of my favorite food: chicken casserole
